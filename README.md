## Storaged variables

Every time a combat ends, the number of the jumps, blocks, kicks, punches and the damage taken from each player is stored in an XML file. Besides, we also record if the game ended with a KO or because of the players run out of time.
The xml file is called savegame.xml

## Controls
### Ryu

* SPACE - Jump.
* A - Move left.
* D - Move right.
* S - Crouch.
* T - Punch.
* Y - Kick.

### Chun-Li

* RIGHT CONTROL - Jump.
* LEFT - Move left.
* RIGHT - Move right.
* DOWN - Crouch.
* O - Punch.

Those controls are the basics, even though there are special combinations by using movement + attack keys. To block, a player must move backwards when the enemy is attacking.
